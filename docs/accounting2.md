## Understanding extended accounting equation

1. A firm keeps records of the resources that the firm owns (assets) and sources of funds -- shareholder equity (or capital) and liabilities (debt). This is a firm financial position, or balance sheet view of the firm.
   A firm also keeps records of income and expenses that indicate does the firm make a profit or run a loss. This is income statement view of the firm.
   Balance sheet and income statement are derived from the same data linked together in an accounting equation as explained below.

2. Capital and liabilities indicate who has claims on the firm. A claim shows where the money came from and where the money should be distributed if the firm is liquidated. Claims have order of precedence â€“ which are fulfilled first in a liquidation.

3. Shareholder equity are funds provided by firm owners. They expect the firm will make a profit by allocating these funds properly and distribute all or part of this profit back to shareholders as dividend.

4. Liabilities are financial obligations of the firm, they are the records of the debts that a firm owes to other parties. When a firm takes a loan for a bank it is reflected as a liability. Also when some payment is due but not yet fulfilled this amount is also reflected as a firm's liability (for example, interest payment on a loan). Liabilities classified based on duration as current liabilities (due within a year) and long term liabilities (due at time beyond one year).

5. Assets is everything that is owned by the firm and what can be converted into cash. Assets are classified into fixed assets (like property, plant, and equipment) and current assets (like cash and inventory).

6. Traditionally, an accounting identity is written as `Assets = Equity + Liabilities`. This is a published form of balance sheet statement at the end of an accounting period, a quarter or a year. In this representation the current period profit was distributed to dividend and to retained earnings and does not appear on a balance sheet.

7. Profit of the firm is revenue (or sales, or income) less expenses associated with this revenue: `Profit = Income - Expenses`. The report containing this data is called income statement.
   In accounting equation profit is recorded on the right side where capital and liabilities side. Why so? Profit is an increment of capital invested into the firm, so it appears next to equity. When no dividends are paid, all of the current profit will add to retained earnings, which is a component of equity. When the firm incurs a loss, this loss will diminish the firm capital.

8. Within a reporting period, the accounting equation can be written as `Assets = Equity + Profit + Liabilities`, where `Profit` is the current period profit before dividend.
   Substituting `Profit = Income - Expenses` into the equation and rearranging we get the extended form of the accounting identity:

```
Assets + Expenses = Equity + Liabilities + Income
```

9. The extended accounting equation above always holds true. Whenever a new accounting transaction is recorded you are just changing some variables in this equation. In a double entry, you change two variables, in a compound entry you change several variables. If you try to record just one change, for example, just receipt of cash from a customer as increase in Assets, the equation will break. For cash receipt from customer, you should record an increase in Income and an equal increase in Assets.

10. You may experiment thinking of various business transactions and provide examples of four types of double entries:

- two variables of the right side are changed;
- two variables of the left side are changed;
- both left side and right side are increased;
- both right side and left side are decreased.

11. You do not specifically need debits and credits to manipulate the extended accounting equation. The debits and credits are just a convenient notation system that helps denote which accounts are increased and which decreased. Understanding the extended accounting equation if far more important and should come before the debit and credit system.

12. A "real" accounting system would need several additions including:

- contra accounts;
- closing of accounts at period end, distribution of current profit into dividend and retained earnings;
- accrual basis for recording receivables and payables;
- depreciation and amortization concepts;
- deferred or accrued income and expenses and adjustment entries;
- valuation changes;
- composition of financial reports.
