# Alternatives

## JavaScript

- [medici](https://github.com/flash-oss/medici) (JavaScript) is a ledger store optimized for high loads (does not enforce any chart of accounts conventions).

## Python

- [pyluca](https://github.com/datasignstech/pyluca) is actively developed and has practical use in mind, coined a term 'headless ledger' (different interface and data structures than `abacus`).
- [ledger.py](https://github.com/mafm/ledger.py) started about 10 years ago with Python 2, was once a [hledger](https://hledger.org/) competitor, has good documentation, but last commit in 2018.

## Plain text accounting

- `Ledger`, `hledger` and `beancount` are leaders in [plain text accounting](https://plaintextaccounting.org/#tools)
- See also [gnucash](https://www.gnucash.org/)

## More information

- Open source ERPs (Odoo, ERPNext) all have accounting functionality.
- [`double-entry-accounting`](https://github.com/topics/double-entry-accounting) tag on Github
  is an extra clue for open source accounting information.
