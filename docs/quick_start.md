# Quick start

With `abacus` you can do the following parts of accounting work:

1. define a chart of accounts,
2. post entries to ledger,
3. make trial balance and adjustment entries,
4. close accounts at period end,
5. make balance sheet and income statement.

There is no cashflow statement yet, other simplifications also
apply (one currency, unique account identifiers).
