FIXME:
- bx ledger init must fail when file is present
- `--title` fails when written first with post entry (see fail.sh)

TODO:
- [ ] memo + build-you-own-x
- [ ] RAS codes 
- [ ] --requires flag in alias 
- [ ] more textbook examples
- [ ] adjustment example (with trial balance)

WONTFIX:
- [ ] injest .as file with bx ... commands
- [ ] adjust and postclose entries
- [ ] --title for csv file
- [ ] help messages
- [ ] types of entries (S,B,A,C1,C2,C3,C4,P)
- [ ] post entry with chart check
- [ ] adjustment and post-close entries
- [ ] `--reference` or `--refer` or meta
- [ ] post-close example
- [ ] add operation title to entry title
- [ ] add small hash for entry
- [ ] `--cash` asset type
- [ ] `--current-asset`, `--non-current-asset` asset type
- [ ] `--current-liability`, `--long-term-liability`
- [ ] write to and read from Excel file

Wont fix:
- [ ] `ledger list` must show nicer output
- [ ] testing of a multiline string `pytest-console-plugin`

FOR REVIEW:
- [x] open ledger with starting balances
- [x] multiple entry
- [x] --rich or --json flags
- [x] show operations in chart
- [x] add account types to trial balance
- [x] merge test suites 
- [x] mount as bx
