# Fool's Guide to Accounting

1. Firm.

---

A firm is a pool of resources under control of firm management.
The firm management was hired to generate profit by using these resources.
The profit will be distributed to firm shareholders.

Questions:

- What are synonyms to a term 'firm'?
- Why firms emerge?
- What is limited liability?
- What are types of firms?

2. Sources of funds: equity and debt.

---

Where did the funds for a company come from? There are two primary sources -
funds contributed by shareholders (**equity**) and funds borrowed from
creditors (**debt**).

Debt is part of company liabilities. Liabilities are financial claims to
the company or company's financial obligations that need to be settled
in the future. For example, accounts payable to suppliers is a liability
of a company.

In addition, we will illustrate below that profit is also a source of funds.
(This may be one of the insights or checkpoints in understanding accounting.)

Questions:

- How are company debt and equity different?
- Provide example of borrowed funds, or company debt.
- What remuneration do shareholders and creditors get for providing funds to a firm?
- Does position of a shareholder and a creditor differ in a situation
  when a firm goes bankrupt?
- Provide example of a company financial liability.
- What is a share, loan, bond?

3. Allocation of funds: assets.

---

After the firm got the funds from shareholders and creditors
it aims to allocate these funds into various types of resources
that are needed to generating profit. For example, cash can be
spent on buying raw materials or equipment. Some part of funds
is kept in cash as a precaution.

Collectively all these resources are called **assets** of the firm.
An asset is everything a firm owns, gives economic benefit
and can be converted into when sold cash.

4. Accounting equation.

---

Assets, or allocation of funds at any given moment in time,
and sources of funds, an indication where the funds came up from,
make up an accounting equation. The equation says, "here is
what the firms owns, the assets, and here is who has claims
on these assets -- the creditors and the shareholders."

```
Assets = Capital (Equity) + Liabilities
```

This accounting equation is valid at accounting period start
and accounting period end after current period profit is
distributed to retained earnings and dividend.

There is a slightly more neglected, but even more useful
extended accounting equation. It adds to the picture the temporary
accounts -- income and expenses -- that are "closed" at period end.

4. Profit is income less expenses. Profit is a source of funds.

---

The goal of a company is to generate profit for shareholders.
How do we count profit? It is amount revenue, or income,
less expenses associated with this revenue. Economically the profit
is an increase of capital provided by shareholders.

There are two ways current profit may be used. First, it can be distributed to shareholders as dividends, allowing them to receive a return on their investment. Alternatively, the profit can be retained within the company if there are favorable growth opportunities for the business. By retaining the profit, the company can reinvest it in research and development, expansion, or acquisitions that should enhance the company's future performance and create long-term value for shareholders.
