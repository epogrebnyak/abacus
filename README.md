A minimal, yet valid double-entry accounting system, provided as `abacus-py` Python package and the `bx` command line tool.

Using `abacus` you can:

- define a chart of accounts,
- post regular and adjustment entries to ledger,
- make trial balance,
- close accounts at period end,
- produce balance sheet and income statement.

> I think it's a great idea to mock-up a mini GL ERP to really get a foundational understanding of how the accounting in ERP works!

> I teach accounting information systems... I'd be tempted to use abacus as a way of simply showing the structure of a simple AIS.

> Hey, what a cool job, thanks much. Do you plan to make a possibility for RAS accounting?

## Install

```
pip install abacus-py
```

This will install both `abacus-py` package and the `bx` command line tool.

For latest version install from github:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/epogrebnyak/abacus.git
```

`abacus-py` requires Python 3.10 or higher.

## Minimal command line example

Ð¡reate temporary directory where `chart.json` and `entries.csv` will be created:

```
mkdir -p scripts/try && cd scripts/try
```

Create chart of accounts:

```bash
bx chart init
bx chart add --asset cash
bx chart add --asset ar --title "Accounts receivable"
bx chart add --asset goods --title "Inventory (goods for resale)"
bx chart add --asset prepaid_rent --title "Storage facility prepaid rent"
bx chart add --capital equity
bx chart add --liability dividend_due
bx chart add --income sales
bx chart offset sales discounts
bx chart add --expense cogs --title "Cost of goods sold"
bx chart add --expense sga --title "Selling, general and adm. expenses"
bx chart alias --operation invoice --debit ar --credit sales
bx chart alias --operation cost --debit cogs --credit goods
bx chart show
```

Start ledger, post entries and close accounts at period end:

```bash
bx ledger init
bx ledger post entry --debit cash  --credit equity --amount 5000 --title "Initial investment"
bx ledger post entry --debit goods --credit cash   --amount 3500 --title "Acquire goods for cash"
bx ledger post entry --debit prepaid_rent --credit cash --amount 1200 --title "Prepay rent"
bx ledger post operation invoice 4300 cost 2500 --title "Issue invoice and register sales"
bx ledger post entry --debit discounts --credit ar --amount  450 --title "Provide discount"
bx ledger post entry --debit cash  --credit ar     --amount 3000 --title "Accept payment"
bx ledger post entry --debit sga   --credit cash   --amount  300 --title "Reimburse sales team"
bx ledger post entry --debit sga --credit prepaid_rent --amount 800 --title "Expense 8 months of rent" --adjust
bx ledger close
bx ledger post entry --debit re --credit dividend_due --amount 150 --title "Accrue dividend" --after-close
```

Make reports:

```bash
bx report --trial-balance
bx report --balance-sheet
bx report --income-statement
```

Inspect accounts:

```bash
bx account sales
bx assert cash 3000
bx balances --nonzero
```

The results should look similar to this:

```
Balance sheet
Assets                          5500  Capital              5500
- Cash                          2700  - Equity             5000
- Accounts receivable           1500  - Retained earnings   500
- Inventory (goods for resale)  1300  Liabilities             0
Total                           5500  Total                5500

Income statement
Income                                                     3500
- Sales                                                    3500
Expenses                                                   3000
- Cost of goods sold                                       2700
- Selling, general and adm. expenses                        300
Profit                                                      500
```

## Feedback

Anything missing in `abacus`?
Got a good use case for `abacus` or used `abacus` for teaching?

Feel free to contact `abacus` author
in [issues](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/abacus/issues),
on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/iamevpo)
or via [Telegram](https://t.me/epoepo).

Your feedback is highly appreciated and should help steering `abacus` development.

## Contributions

### Program design

`abacus` is designed around core accounting concepts such as
chart of accounts, general ledger, accounting entry and financial reports.
These concepts correspond to classes created inside `abacus`:
`Chart`, `Ledger`, `Entry`, `BalanceSheet` and `IncomeStatement`.

Here is a basic workflow how these classes interact:

- you add necessary accounts to `Chart` indicating account type,
- from `Chart` you create empty `Ledger`,
- an `Entry` or a list of entries `[Entry]` can be posted to `Ledger`,
- there is a procedure to create a list of closing entries and these
  closing entries are also posted to ledger;
- from `Ledger` you can get account balances;
- the account balances are used to create trial balance, `BalanceSheet` and
  `IncomeStatement`.

As seen in the code in README, you can use just `abacus.Chart` and `abacus.Entry`
classes to write code for the entire accounting cycle as other classes
(`Ledger`, balances, `BalanceSheet` and `IncomeStatement`) will be derived form
`Chart` and `Entry`.

In the sequence above the most tricky part are probably the closing entries,
thus special care is given to documenting them in the `abacus.closing` module.

Handling contra accounts also required some thinking to implement, but
I believe we have contra accounts nicely covered in the `abacus`
type system (there is a contra account class for each account class,
e.g. `Asset` and `ContraAsset`).

Fro storage of data we persist the chart and the entries and we do not save the
state of the ledger. Given the chart (from `chart.json` file) and
accounting entries (from the `entries.json` file) we can calculate
ledger state at any time. This may seem a bit counter-intuitive, but think
of entries as deltas to the original state of the ledger.

If you into functional programming, the entire type signature for
`abacus` is the following:

```
Chart -> [Entry] -> Ledger -> [ClosingEntry] -> Ledger -> (BalanceSheet, IncomeStatement)
```

In general, what `abacus` (as well as any other double entry program) does is
maintaining an extended accounting equation in balance.
If you are comfortable with this idea, the rest of program flow and code
should be more natural to follow.

Note that "real" ERP and accounting systems do a lot more than double entry accounting,
for example keeping the original documents and maintaining identities for the
clients and suppliers as well as keeping extra data about contracts and
whatever management accounting may need to have a record of. Validating
and invalidating entries is also a common task.

Most of this of this is out of scope for double entry ledger.
We just need a chart of accounts, create a ledger based on chart,
post entries that have information about debit, credit and amount,
close ledger at period end and produce reports, plus allow checking
the trail balance and doing adjustment and post-close entries if needed.

### Testing

You will need [just command runner](https://github.com/casey/just)
and [poetry package manager](https://python-poetry.org/) for developing
`abacus`.

All commands I use for testing are gathered in `just grill` command.
This command will launch:

- `pytest` for unit tests
- `mypy` to check type annotations
- `isort` to sort imports
- `black` for code formatting
- `ruff` for code check and linting
- `prettier` to clean markdown files
- console scripts and Python code from README to keep README up to date
- bash scripts with command line interface commands as additional tests.

I found that testing CLI with a few bash files, each for chart, ledger, reports and
show commands, accelerates the workflow.
