How I understand accounting
===========================

1. A firm keeps  records of what the firm owns (assets) and sources of funds: shareholder equity (or capital) and liabilities (debt).

2. Capital and liabilities indicate where money came from and where they should be distributed if the firm is liquidated. Capital and li–∞bilities are the records of claims on the firm.

3. Shareholder equity is funds provided by firm owners. The shareholder expects the firm will make a profit and distribute all or part of this profit back to shareholders as dividend.

4. Liabilities are financial obligations of the firm, these are the records of the debts that a firm owes to other parties. For example, when a firm takes a loan for a bank it is reflected as a liability.

5. Asset is everything that is owned by the firm and what can be converted into cash. Assets are classified into fixed assets (like property, plant, equipment, or PPE) and current assets (like cash and inventory - raw material, work in progress and finished goods).

6. Traditionally, an accounting identity is written as `Assets = Equity + Liabilities`.
This is a published form of balance sheet statement at the end of an accounting period
(eg a year). In this balance sheet we do not see the current period profit as it was distributed
to dividend and retained earnings and does not appear on a balance sheet.

7. Profit of the firm is revenue (or sales, or income) less expenses: Profit = Income - Expenses. The report containing this data is known as income statement.

The income statement shows the performance of the company over a period of time, typically a year, and it includes the current period profit. The current profit (net income) is either then transferred to the balance sheet as retained earnings or paid out as dividend.

8. There are 5 types of accounts:
- Assets
- Equity
- Liabilities
- Income
- Expenses

9. These accounts are linked in the following way. Within a reporting period, the accounting equation can be written as:

 `Assets = Equity + Profit + Liabilities`, where `Profit` is the current period profit. 

Substituting `Profit = Income - Expenses` into the equation above and rearranging we get the extended form of the accounting identity:

Assets + Expenses = Equity + Liabilities + Income.  

This equation should always hold true whenever a new accounting transaction is recorded, as it reflects the basic principles of double-entry bookkeeping. This is not a financial reporting form, unlike balance sheet (6) and income statement (7).

10. After we add detail into each type of account we will get a ledger of accounts ready to record transactions. A simple example:

```
Assets = Cash + Inventory
Expenses = Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
Equity = Shareholder Equity
Income = Sales
(no fixed assets, no debt, no receivables/payables).

Accounting equation:

Cash + Inventory + Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) = Shareholder Equity + Sales
```

11. A "real" accounting system would need following additions:

- distribution of current profit into dividend and retained earnings at period end
- accrual basis (receivables/payables)
- depreciation/amortization
- deferred taxes, deferred income or expenses
- valuation changes

Notes:

- Why profit is recorded on the same side as equity? Profit is an increment of capital invested into the firm, so it appears next to equity. When no dividends are paid, all of the current profit will add to retained earnings, which is a component of equity.
